            I, Lukas Krampitz, am a Second-Year student at the University of
            Guelph. I am currently studying in a Bachelors of Computer Engineering program.
            I have a fascination and passion for computers and problem solving.

            <p>
              I have a love of programming and software as seen in my Catan game
              and my website projects. But I equally if not more love hardware
              and electronics, as seen in my Model M collection, and 8-bit full
              adder. A lot of my time is spent around computers. This extends to
              work, such as my time in the Geek Squad at Best Buy fixing
              computers. And it also extends to play, enjoying single player
              games like KSP and Hitman, and multiplayer games like Factorio,
              Civ VI, and Stardew Valley.
            </p>

            <p>
              I enjoy travelling, and have been to quite a few countries
              including Estonia, Sweden, Finland, Norway, Italy, and most often
              of all Germany. I love biking on my Devinci Oslo, and take it all
              around the city. I also love downhill skiing and am particularly
              fond of glade skiing and getting lost in the trees.
