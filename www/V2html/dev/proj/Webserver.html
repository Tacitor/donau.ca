                My personal website started in a very early form in and around April or May of 2019. In its earliest
                form it was hosted on a domain I registered for free. This free domain expired after a year and was
                quickly replaced with a malware site. At the time when I owned danube.ga there was no malware on it, but
                instead the first site was a quick and dirty recipe book that I made as a school project. This recipe
                book was used as a placeholder to park on the domain as I developed my HTML and CSS skills. As I learned
                more, I made a few revisions to the recipe book, but it was quickly replaced. Soon after I replaced the
                site with another quick and dirty site, this time to display some python code I had written.

                        Then once I decided I learned enough HTML and CSS I displayed the first real website I ever
                        made, a short Biography of Konrad Zuse. The website is nothing special and it is noticeably
                        clear that it was made by a beginner, but I still has a certain sentimental value to me being
                        the first real page I ever made fully just using HTML and CSS. This was one of the projects for
                        my grade 10 ICS2O course. Soon I created a terrible landing page that was only ever intended to
                        be a temporary solution to function as an interim page to select from a few of my projects. This
                        hideous page then stuck around for the next 3 years... Now one could select from a few projects
                        including the original Konrad Zuse biography, as well as a return of the python code collection.
                        Additionally, I would then add more projects to the temporary landing site as I made more.

                Eventually when the first domain expired, I got another free domain that would then eventually also turn
                into a malware site. The new domain danube-river.ga then hosted the same temporary landing page that the
                old domain had. After another year, this domain expired again and was turned into a malware site, even
                though I again elected auto renewal. Though I guess that is the kind of service a free registrar
                delivers. This led me to purchase my first real domain on February 4th. I first tried to buy a domain
                similar to what I had previously such as danube.com or danube.ca but they were not available. Then I
                wanted to see if the German equivalent of danube was available, and it was. This led me to
                <a class="cust_anchor" href="https://donau.ca">donau.ca</a> and I bought it immediately.

                        Throughout the entire history of the webpage and domain the one constant has been the webserver.
                        My webserver has always been my trusty Raspberry Pi 3 B+ that I bought back in and around April
                        or May of 2019. Currently the Pi is running Raspbian 11 Bullseye, a fork of Debian. The little
                        micro-computer takes care of all way webhosting needs. It primarily runs the Apache 2 HTTP
                        Server Project as the host of the various web pages. The little Raspberry Pi also runs a few
                        other services such as certificate generation and renewal for the TLS certification. This
                        ensures clients can connect over port 443 using the HTTPS protocol instead of just HTTP. to the
                        donau.ca domains, and various sub domains. Also running on the Raspberry Pi, I have a Plex Media
                        server, and an OpenVPN VPN server. All the maintenance on my personal Raspberry Pi 3 B+ is
                        conducted remotely. The micro-computer is run in a headless mode without any display, mouse, or
                        keyboard attached. The only connection to the hardware is power, and an ethernet cable. Using
                        either a VNC client or SSH I remotely access the server. Then I can run and perform any
                        maintenance I need to. The beauty of this system is that since I am also running a VPN server on
                        this Raspberry Pi. Therefore, I can connect to the VPN from anywhere and then use VNC like I
                        normally would to connect to the server. This allows me to perform maintenance from any stable
                        internet connection. This is a neat feature that I have made quite a bit of use of.

                As of writing on June 24th, 2023, I am currently in Niedersachsen, Germany and make heavy use of the
                remote access to update the website, and webserver even from here. This Raspberry Pi has been a great
                tool and learning experience. Having a server that exclusively runs Linux is a really terrific way to
                make yourself learn Linux. I would say I have become fairly proficient at interfacing with the OS using
                either a CLI or a GUI. I am nowhere near an expert, but I can navigate the environment fairly well, and
                know enough to allow me to google my way to an answer.
