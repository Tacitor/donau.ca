            <strong>Step 1:</strong> Start by crushing your black peppercorns and then straining them through a fine mesh sieve. Pour what’s in the sieve into a bowl and set aside.<br>
            <strong>Step 2:</strong> Season both sides of your filet mignons heavily with salt and then let them sit at room temperature for 30 minutes up to an hour.<br>
            <strong>Step 3:</strong> In a deep saute pan melt 1 stick of butter. Once it’s bubbly, add your carrots. Slow cook them in the butter for 10-15 minutes, stirring constantly. Add ½ cup of bourbon and once the alcohol has cooked out add ¼ cup of orange juice along with 2-3 Tbsp of brown sugar. Cook until a syrupy glaze has formed. Season with some freshly chopped thyme along with salt and pepper. <br>
            <strong>Step 4:</strong> Par-boil the peas for about 2 minutes and then immediately put them in an ice bath (unless they are frozen peas, in which case you can skip that step). Strain the peas. Melt ½ a stick of butter in a pan and then add 1 chopped shallot. Saute for 2 minutes and then add peas. When peas are tender add 2 Tbsp of chopped mint, and the zest of one lemon. Season with salt and pepper. Mix to combine.<br>
            <strong>Step 5:</strong> Pat the steaks dry and then add them to a hot skillet with vegetable oil. Pan sear the steaks for about 4 minutes per side over a medium high heat. Add ½ a stick of butter and baste the steaks until they reach your desired internal temperature. Set aside and let rest for 10 minutes.<br>
            <strong>Step 6:</strong> Wipe out the pan and then add your crushed peppercorns. Toast for about 20-30 seconds. Remove from heat and add ½ a cup of cognac. Once the alcohol has cooked out, add ½ cup beef stock (before using, boil down 1 cup of beef stock to ½ a cup of beef stock) along with ½ cup of heavy cream. Whisk to combine. Keep stirring and simmering until it thickens up and then add 2 Tbsp of butter. Mix to combine.<br>
            <strong>Step 7:</strong> Add steak, peas, and carrots to a plate. Top steak with sauce, serve and enjoy!<br>
