                <h3>Mastermind:</h3>
                <p>In this game the program generates a code. The code consists of three colors: red, green, blue and yellow. Such a code might look like this: Red Red Blue, or maybe like Yellow, Green, Red. The goal of the user, or guesser is to crack the code in as few tries as possible. You might get lucky and get it first try, but if you don't there is no need to worry. Part of the game is that hints are given, it tells you how many of the colours you guesses are in the code but not the right order or spot, and it also tells you how many are the right color in the right order or spot.<br><br>
