                    After learning about Full Adders and Ripple Carry Adders in ENGG*2410 — Digital Systems Design in the Fall semester of 2023, I wanted to
                    build an 8-Bit ripple carry adder at home. The issue being that I do not own a Xilinx FPGA and therefore would need a different strategy
                    than the one used in ENGG*2410. Luckily though I had a few breadboards and Quad 2-input Logic ICs. Specifically, XOR, AND, and OR logic
                    chips. Each 14 pin DIP logic chip had 4 logic gates on it. Each gate has two input pins and an output pin. This leaves one more pin of the
                    DIP package for a VCC connection and then one more for ground. The first step in the process was to plan out the 8-Bit ripple carry adder. A
                    plan of the logic was made using AutoCAD.

                    Then a new block diagram was made that incorporated the pinout of the DIP ICs. This was again made using AutoCAD and like the above image it
                    was exported as an SVG so that all the details can be zoomed in on. This new block diagram was made to get a better understanding for how to
                    plan out the wires and connections that would be needed for the physical assembly of the 8-Bit adder.

                    Once this was done I began assembling the breadboards. I began by layout all the ICs I would need. In this project I made use of:

                    <ul class="ul_li_proj">
                        <li>4 x 74x86 Quad 2-input XOR ICs</li>
                        <li>4 x 74x08 Quad 2-input AND ICs</li>
                        <li>2 x 74x32 Quad 2-input OR ICs</li>
                        <li>2 x DIP 8 Switches Board</li>
                        <li>2 x Full sized Breadboards</li>
                        <li>1 x Mini Breadboard</li>
                        <li>5 x 200Ω Resistors</li>
                        <li>8 x 10KΩ small Resistors</li>
                        <li>8 x 10KΩ larger Resistors</li>
                        <li>Many many wires</li>
                    </ul>

                    The ICs were split up and places evenly across the two full sized breadboards. The final results can be seen below.
