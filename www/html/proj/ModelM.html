                    As of writing I have restored three separate IBM keyboard.
                    Two of which are proper Model M keyboards, one blue badge
                    and one grey oval badge. The other keyboard is an M122
                    Battlecruiser. The M122 is the first IBM keyboard I ever
                    found, used, and have restored. Found in the dusty server
                    room equipment locker of my employer at the time I found it
                    discarded in a pile of unused parts. My M122 was once used
                    as the terminal access keyboard of the AS/400 mainframe that
                    the company used as its database. As a quick side note the
                    company still uses an AS/400 running the exact same data
                    base management software as of writing in July 2023, albeit
                    through an emulator.

                            When I found my M122 it was not in good shape, and I
                            asked my boss if I could have it since it clearly
                            hasn't been used in years. He agreed and I began to
                            research how to restore such a keyboard. The first
                            step was a cleaning process since it was absolutely
                            disgusting when I found it. The keyboard was covered
                            in ancient dust and grime, covered in marker and pen
                            ink, and missing key caps. Another issues I would
                            face is that the keyboard uses an 8P8C connector.

                            In order to clean the keyboard, I first needed to
                            disassemble it. This could only be done once I took
                            out the screws. Sadly, I did not have a compatible
                            driver, nor did any hardware store I could find. To
                            take off the back panel I would need a hex driver,
                            but I was not sure which one driver. I was able to
                            borrow a kit from my other place of employment and
                            through trial and error I discovered I needed a 5.5
                            mm hex driver. Upon first disassembly of the
                            keyboard, I was finally able to find a part number
                            on the birth certificate of the keyboard. This M122
                            was made 28. August 1998 by IBM in the UK. It is P/N
                            1394167 but really has an Assembly Part Number of
                            1394177. I put the keyboard back together and
                            returned the driver to my place of work the
                            following day. Using the new identifying
                            information, I had now found I began more
                            researching and was able to put together a plan on
                            how to clean and restore the keyboard to working
                            order. The first step was to order a precision
                            driver kit which I did. Now I was able to open the
                            keyboard whenever I needed.

                            Before beginning to clean the keyboard I first
                            wanted to see if I could even get it working again.
                            But because I do not have any devices that connects
                            to a keyboard over an 8P8C connector I needed to
                            make an adapter first. In my research I came across
                            a device called a Soarer's Converter. This is a
                            little device that will actively convert the signals
                            from the M122 to a USB keyboard signaling. To build
                            my Soarer's Converter I used a Pro Micro Arduino
                            clone. It is a little microcontroller that uses an
                            ATmega32U4 processor. It uses the firmware written
                            by this person by the name of Soarer and uses a
                            custom config I wrote for the M122 Battlecruiser.
                            This custom config was needed because there is
                            certain key that do not work. While testing I found
                            that the left shift key does not respond. Therefore,
                            the translation microcontroller will <i>press</i> a
                            shift key when the play button left of the shift key
                            is pressed. To connect the convert to the keyboard a
                            female-male dupont cable is used. The female end of
                            the dupont cable is used to connect to the pinout on
                            the PCB of the keyboard. Then the male ends of the
                            dupont cable are bent over and soldered into the
                            through holes of the Pro Micro. Then the converter
                            is connected to a USB cable with a micro-B connector
                            on the keyboard side and a type-A connector on the
                            PC side. Then once I was able to get the converter
                            to work and I was able to confirm that the keyboard
                            works. The next step was then to clean the keyboard.
                            The task was split into two section, the parts that
                            can tolerate water, and the parts that cannot. For
                            the upper and lower chassis, they were washed in the
                            tub with soapy water. It was very challenging to get
                            all the ink off and some of it I had to leave on.
                            The back plate, barrel plate, membrane, and springs
                            needed to be cleaned with 99% isopropanol. The
                            barrel plate was absolutely covered in ancient dust
                            and grime. It took many cotton swabs and cotton
                            balls to remove it all.

                            balls to remove it all. While I was scrubbing away
                            at the barrel plate, they key stems and the key caps
                            were soaking in a light soapy water bath. I made
                            sure to use distilled water so that there would be
                            no friction causing mineral deposits on the keys
                            when they dried. I would stir the key soup every ten
                            minutes or so just to try and get as much gunk to
                            soften up and get washed off of the keys. Then I
                            laid out the keys on a towel and set up a fan to
                            blow air across then to speed up the drying process.
                            I left them like this for 24-48 hours. To check if
                            all the water has evaporated, I blew into the base
                            of the key stems, if I felt water droplets spray
                            back into my face then I knew they were not yet dry.

                    Then in about July of 2022 I was informed by a colleague
                    that was cleaning in the electrical room that there were
                    'two more of those ugly keyboards' in the electrical room.
                    This is when I came into two more IBM keyboards. These were
                    true Model Ms. One is a grey oval badge and the other a blue
                    badge. I also restored these keyboards. These two though did
                    not need a Soarer's Converter though because they connect
                    with a PS/2 port which is still a commonly available enough
                    connector as of writing. Once I was done restoring the blue
                    badge Model M I gave it to a friend of mine for their
                    birthday, reducing my collection back down to only two.
