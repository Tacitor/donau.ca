                    As of writing I have restored three separate IBM keyboard.
                    Two of which are proper Model M keyboards, one blue badge
                    and one grey oval badge. The other keyboard is an M122
                    Battlecruiser. The M122 is the first IBM keyboard I ever
                    found, used, and have restored. Found in the dusty server
                    room equipment locker of my employer at the time I found it
                    discarded in a pile of unused parts. My M122 was once used
                    as the terminal access keyboard of the AS/400 mainframe that
                    the company used as its database. As a quick side note the
                    company still uses an AS/400 running the exact same data
                    base management software as of writing in July 2023, albeit
                    through an emulator.

                            When I found my M122 it was not in good shape, and I
                            asked my boss if I could have it since it clearly
                            hasn't been used in years. He agreed and I began to
                            research how to restore such a keyboard. The first
                            step was a cleaning process since it was absolutely
                            disgusting when I found it. The keyboard was covered
                            in ancient dust and grime, covered in marker and pen
                            ink, and missing key caps. Another issues I would
                            face is that the keyboard uses an 8P8C connector.

                            In order to clean the keyboard, I first needed to
                            disassemble it. This could only be done once I took
                            out the screws. Sadly, I did not have a compatible
                            driver, nor did any hardware store I could find. To
                            take off the back panel I would need a hex driver,
                            but I was not sure which one driver. I was able to
                            borrow a kit from my other place of employment and
                            through trial and error I discovered I needed a 5.5
                            mm hex driver. Upon first disassembly of the
                            keyboard, I was finally able to find a part number
                            on the birth certificate of the keyboard. This M122
                            was made 28. August 1998 by IBM in the UK. It is P/N
                            1394167 but really has an Assembly Part Number of
                            1394177. I put the keyboard back together and
                            returned the driver to my place of work the
                            following day. Using the new identifying
                            information, I had now found I began more
                            researching and was able to put together a plan on
                            how to clean and restore the keyboard to working
                            order. The first step was to order a precision
                            driver kit which I did. Now I was able to open the
                            keyboard whenever I needed.
