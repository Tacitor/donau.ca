                    As of writting I have restored three seperate IBM keyboard.
                    Two of which are propper Model M keyboards, one blue badge
                    and one grey oval badge. The other keyboard is an M122
                    Battlecruiser. The M122 is the first IBM keyboard I ever
                    found, used, and have restored. Found in the dusty server
                    room equiptment locker of my employer at the time I found it
                    discarded in a pile of unused parts. My M122 was once used
                    as the terminal access keyobard of the AS/400 mainframe that
                    the company used as its database. As a quick side note the
                    company still uses an AS/400 running the exact same data
                    base managemnt software as of writting in July 2023, albeiet
                    thorugh an emulator.

                            When I found my M122 it was not in good shape, and I
                            asked my boss if I could have it since it clearly
                            hasn't been used in years. He agreed and I begen to
                            research how to restore such a keyboard. The first
                            step was a cleaning process, since it was abolutly
                            disgusting when I found it.
