                            The JSON Routine File Processor is the final project
                            of the ENGG*1420 OOP Course I took in the winter
                            2023 semester at the UoG. It was developed by a team
                            of 6. The program is written entirely in Java and
                            makes use of the Laserfiche company's remote
                            repository API. The program has the ability to read
                            in a .JSON file using the Jackson JSON parser for
                            Java. The structure from the JSON is stored in a
                            Plain Old Java Object (POJO) hierarchy that extracts
                            the relational structure from the JSON. The POJO
                            structure is then passed off the Sequencer that
                            converts the POJO structure into a class hierarchy
                            using feature rich classes that possess methods to
                            process data.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The .JSON file contains all the instructions for a
                            given processing scenario. Every scenario is broken
                            up into processing elements. A processing element
                            performs an action. It might act as a filter, or
                            print out information, or list child directories or
                            files. Each Processing element is required to have
                            input entries and parameters. The input entries can
                            be either remote or local entries. Any entry can
                            either be a file or a directory (folder). This
                            yields a total of 4 possible identities for an
                            entry. This means an Entry is either a local File,
                            local Folder, remote File, or remote Folder. The
                            JSON file then provides the parameters of the
                            processing element, which are specific to each type
                            of processing element. One thing to note is that
                            only the first processing element needs to provide
                            the input entries. All subsequent processing
                            elements will take their input directly from the
                            output of the previous processing element.
                        </p>

                <div class="txt_section">

                    All of this allows the JSON Routine File Processor to
                    automatically process, many Entries at once. This might
                    include listing all the sub folders in a given folder and
                    renaming all the folders at once. Then Go into each
                    subfolder and select only text files that contain the phrase
                    "Object Oriented Programming". The next processing element
                    might further narrow down the selected Entries to only ones
                    that are over 500 MB in size. The final processing element
                    might then print out the meta data of the remaining files.

                            This project made heavy use of GitHub to control the
                            versions of the program while it was in development.
                            Many of the team members were writing new code and
                            changing existing code in parallel with others
                            simultaneously. We made heavy use of branches and
                            only merged in changes to the main branch once a
                            given feature was complete.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            This project has the most intertwined and convoluted
                            network graph of any other project I have worked on
                            to date. This is a result of the large amount of
                            parallelization and simultaneous work as all 6
                            members were working on the project. If you scroll
                            all the way to the right on the network graph it
                            even appears that some commits were made weaving in
                            and out of April 2nd and 3rd. Quite frankly I am not
                            sure what causes this strange time travel behavior
                            to appear as such on the graph.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Another interesting aspect of this project is that
                            it is able to interface with a remote repository
                            from the Laserfiche company. These repos have a very
                            novel file structure. In a given repository each
                            entry is identified exclusively with an entry ID.
                            There is no file structure, or access to the nested
                            folder. If a folder contains other entries, then
                            this is discovered by using the API to specifically
                            query for child entries. These child entries can
                            again just be directly accessed with the Entry ID
                            without needing to even know it exists withing a
                            folder. These quirks made it very interesting to get
                            both local entries and remote entries interoperable.
