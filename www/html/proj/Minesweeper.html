                    This is a little game that I made with a friend of mine. It
                    was the final summative project for TEJ4M, my Grade 12
                    Computer Engineering course. The game is based off of the
                    popular and well-known game of Minesweeper, with an added
                    multiplayer twist. The game we made together is written in
                    Java and makes use of Sockets to allow for the online
                    multiplayer functionality. We split up the work fairly
                    evenly. I was in charge of making the main menu, and its
                    interactions with sub menus and the main game. I was also
                    responsible for writing the net code and ensuring 2
                    computers could connect to play the game. My partner Ehsan
                    was responsible for writing the main game and all the
                    functionality it needed.

                            The main portion of the game has two small
                            Minesweeper boards next to each other. Each 10x10
                            board is assigned to one player. Each player gets to
                            take their turn one after the other. A turn consists
                            of either scouting a tile or placing a mine on your
                            opponent's board. A player can flag as many tiles as
                            they wish in a given turn, placing flags goes not
                            count as taking your turn. One of the notable
                            addition to this version of the game is the ability
                            to change the opponent's mine field during the play
                            of the game. In place of scouting a tile one can add
                            bombs to your opponent's board instead.

                    We wrote the this game after I had added networking to my
                    <a class="cust_anchor" href="Catan.html">Catan</a> game and
                    the net code is derived off of early versions
                    of the Catan net code. This means the interface it very
                    similar to early catan versions. The spoke-and-hub network
                    architecture is also shared. The game state is transmitted
                    by writing the entire board state and some control variables
                    to a file on disk. Then this file is read in by a separate
                    thread of the program in converted into a serial string of
                    bytes which are sent to the server. The server then
                    redistributes the file to the two clients. Once a client
                    receives an updated game state the thread responsible to
                    connect to the server calls a trigger in the main thread of
                    the program to read in the file off of disk again.
