                    The Nintendo Gameboy Advance is possible one of my favourite
                    handheld consols of all time. I love the form factor, I love
                    the hand feel, the tactile feel of the buttons, and the
                    quaint retro nostalgia it has in the present day. My one and
                    only gripe is that screen is quite awful! So, I took it upon
                    myself to mod in a higher resolution <b>backlight</b> LCD.
                    After a bunch of research on the best way to proceed I
                    decided on buying a new LCD and Shell from funnyplaying.com,
                    though I don't know how reputable of a site this is, all I
                    know is I had a fairly pleasant experience with them, and
                    they even threw is a free pouch for my GBA in along with my
                    purchase.

                        <p class="proj_p">
                            The first step in the process was disassemble the
                            GBA and clean it. While I had only owned my GBA for
                            about 2 years by this point I bought it used and
                            came with a non-zero amount of free grime from the
                            previous user. Once I had cleaned out the inside of
                            the case and mainboard with isopropyl alcohol I
                            could being the mod. The new Backlight LCD had an
                            interesting way of connecting to the display output
                            of the mainboard. A ribbon cable with a section that
                            is also a flex PCB attached to the video output of
                            the GBA's PCB. On the flex PCB of the modded video
                            ribbon cable there are multiple ICs that are used to
                            pixel double upscale the image, and any other signal
                            processing needed to get the image to properly
                            display on the new LCD. The worst part of this mod
                            is the tiny and nearly impossible to attach
                            connecter from the flex PCB to the LCD. Luckily once
                            its connected there isn't a ton of need to remove it
                            or reconnect it.

                    The results were astounding. Seen below on the <b>left</b>
                    is a before shot of the AGB-001 front light LCD. There is an
                    obnoxious screen-door effect, and the colours is way off and
                    very muted and washed out. The viewing angles are terrible
                    and as seen in the image viewing the game in generally
                    unenjoyable. Now on the <b>right</b> is the same game
                    (Pokémon Fire Red) but now on the new backlight LCD. Once I
                    saw this is testing I was super happy and couldn't wait to
                    finish the mod. In the image there are some circles or
                    smudges of discolouration in the bottom left and right that
                    lucky went way once the new LCD settled into the new shell
                    for the GBA.

                            I was very happy I went with a new shell because it
                            means I didn't have to destroy and mod the original
                            shell for my GBA. This means if I ever want to
                            restore the GBA to an original state with the
                            original display and unmodded case I can do so
                            because I kept them both. The new shell has a really
                            nice colour matching of the indigo hue of the
                            original GBA shell. I am able to notice a difference
                            in the grey buttons but it might also be that they
                            just seem newer. Another bonus of the new shell and
                            display and glass cover is that there are no
                            scratches on it now! Once I confirmed it worked I
                            solder on two tiny wires to the flex PCB once each
                            to a pad near each of the Left and Right shoulder
                            pads. This allows me to control the brightness of
                            the display by pressing Select+L to raise the
                            brightness Select+R to lower. This is actually the
                            project that inspired me to learn how to solder.
                            Then I reassembled the rest of the shell and began
                            enjoying the new backlight LCD.

                            As a part of my GBA modding and cleaning journey I
                            also opened up some game cartridges just to take a
                            peek. Seen here are the insides of Pokémon FireRed
                            and Advance Wars 2. Both of which are fantastic
                            games I must add. What is interesting to note is
                            that there is not much going on here, just two ICs
                            and that's it. There aren't any other components on
                            the back either.
