                    The Nintendo Gameboy Advance is possible one of my favourite
                    handheld consols of all time. I love the form factor, I love
                    the hand feel, the tactile feel of the buttons, and the
                    quaint retro nostalgia it has in the present day. My one and
                    only gripe is that screen is quite awful! So, I took it upon
                    myself to mod in a higher resolution <b>backlight</b> LCD.
                    After a bunch of research on the best way to proceed I
                    decided on buying a new LCD and Shell from funnyplaying.com,
                    though I don't know how reputable of a site this is, all I
                    know is I had a fairly pleasant experience with them, and
                    they even threw is a free pouch for my GBA in along with my
                    purchase.

                <div class="break_spacer"></div>

                <div class="img_txt_section">
                    <div class="img_txt_section_txt">
                        <p class="proj_p">
                            The first step in the process was disassemble the
                            GBA and clean it. While I had only owned my GBA for
                            about 2 years by this point I bought it used and
                            came with a non-zero amount of free grime from the
                            previous user. Once I had cleaned out the inside of
                            the case and mainboard with isopropyl alcohol I
                            could being the mod. The new Backlight LCD had an
                            interesting way of connecting to the display output
                            of the mainboard. A ribbon cable with a section that
                            is also a flex PCB attached to the video output of
                            the GBA's PCB. On the flex PCB of the modded video
                            ribbon cable there are multiple ICs that are used to
                            pixel double upscale the image, and any other signal
                            processing needed to get the image to properly
                            display on the new LCD. The worst part of this mod
                            is the tiny and nearly impossible to attach
                            connecter from the flex PCB to the LCD. Luckily once
                            its connected there isn't a ton of need to remove it
                            or reconnect it.

                    Then in about July of 2022 I was informed by a colleague
                    that was cleaning in the electrical room that there were
                    'two more of those ugly keyboards' in the electrical room.
