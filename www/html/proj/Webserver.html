                    My personal website started in a very early form in and
                    around April or May of 2019. In its earliest form it was
                    hosted on a domain I registered for free. This free domain
                    expired after a year and was quickly replaced with a malware
                    site. At the time when I owned danube.ga there was no
                    malware on it, but instead the first site was a quick and
                    dirty recipe book that I made as a school project. This
                    recipe book was used as a placeholder to park on the domain
                    as I developed my HTML and CSS skills. As I learned more, I
                    made a few revisions to the recipe book, but it was quickly
                    replaced. Soon after I replaced the site with another quick
                    and dirty site, this time to display some python code I had
                    written.

                            Then once I decided I learned enough HTML and CSS I
                            displayed the first real website I ever made, a
                            short Biography of Konrad Zuse. The website is
                            nothing special and it is noticeably clear that it
                            was made by a beginner, but I still has a certain
                            sentimental value to me being the first real page I
                            ever made fully just using HTML and CSS. This was
                            one of the projects for my grade 10 ICS2O course.
                            Soon I created a terrible landing page that was only
                            ever intended to be a temporary solution to function
                            as an interim page to select from a few of my
                            projects. This hideous page then stuck around for
                            the next 3 years... Now one could select from a few
                            projects including the original Konrad Zuse
                            biography, as well as a return of the python code
                            collection. Additionally, I would then add more
                            projects to the temporary landing site as I made
                            more.

                <div class="txt_section">

                    Eventually when the first domain expired, I got another free
                    domain that would then eventually also turn into a malware
                    site. The new domain danube-river.ga then hosted the same
                    temporary landing page that the old domain had. After
                    another year, this domain expired again and was turned into
                    a malware site, even though I again elected auto renewal.
                    Though I guess that is the kind of service a free registrar
                    delivers. This led me to purchase my first real domain on
                    February 4th. I first tried to buy a domain similar to what
                    I had previously such as danube.com or danube.ca but they
                    were not available. Then I wanted to see if the German
                    equivalent of danube was available, and it was. This led me
                    to <a class="cust_anchor" href="https://donau.ca">donau.ca</a>
                    and I bought it immediately.

                            Throughout the entire history of the webpage and
                            domain the one constant has been the webserver. My
                            webserver has always been my trusty Raspberry Pi 3
                            B+ that I bought back in and around April or May of
                            2019. Currently the Pi is running Raspbian 11
                            Bullseye, a fork of Debian. The little
                            micro-computer takes care of all way webhosting
                            needs. It primarily runs the Apache 2 HTTP Server
                            Project as the host of the various web pages. The
                            little Raspberry Pi also runs a few other services
                            such as certificate generation and renewal for the
                            TLS certification. This ensures clients can connect
                            over port 443 using the HTTPS protocol instead of
                            just HTTP. to the donau.ca domains, and various sub
                            domains. Also running on the Raspberry Pi, I have a
                            Plex Media server, and an OpenVPN VPN server. All
                            the maintenance on my personal Raspberry Pi 3 B+ is
                            conducted remotely. The micro-computer is run in a
                            headless mode without any display, mouse, or
                            keyboard attached. The only connection to the
                            hardware is power, and an ethernet cable. Using
                            either a VNC client or SSH I remotely access the
                            server. Then I can run and perform any maintenance I
                            need to. The beauty of this system is that since I
                            am also running a VPN server on this Raspberry Pi.
                            Therefore, I can connect to the VPN from anywhere
                            and then use VNC like I normally would to connect to
                            the server. This allows me to perform maintenance
                            from any stable internet connection. This is a neat
                            feature that I have made quite a bit of use of.

                    As of writing on June 24th, 2023, I am currently in
                    Niedersachsen, Germany and make heavy use of the remote
                    access to update the website, and webserver even from here.
                    This Raspberry Pi has been a great tool and learning
                    experience. Having a server that exclusively runs Linux is a
                    really terrific way to make yourself learn Linux. I would
                    say I have become fairly proficient at interfacing with the
                    OS using either a CLI or a GUI. I am nowhere near an expert,
                    but I can navigate the environment fairly well, and know
                    enough to allow me to google my way to an answer.

                        ancestor domains the site has seen various revisions.
                        Over the past few years, I have occasionally saved
                        backups of the source for the website resulting in some
                        snapshots of the previous revisions. Many of these
                        versions of the site are quite crude or primitive and
                        are not representative of my current abilities. For
                        preservation and archival purposes, I do though, still
                        want to make these versions available.
