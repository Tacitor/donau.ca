                    I. The environmental issue
                </div>

                <div class="txt_section txt_section_indent">
                    With a population of 84.5 million citizens the country of
                    Germany has a substantial
                    demand for energy (German Federal Statistical Office, 2022).
                    Much of the electricity production
                    within the nation is through fossil fuels, with 20.1% of
                    power being produced through lignite
                    production (German Federal Statistical Office, 2023).
                    lignite—also referred to as brown coal—is
                    a low grade coal. It is inefficient and emits more CO2 when
                    compared to other types of fossil
                    fuels (University of Calgary, n.d.). Germany has had a long
                    standing dependance on lignite, with
                    it being used in place of wood as a fuel type beginning as
                    early as the 1600's (D-EITI, 2023). In
                    1985 Germany hit a historical record of extracting 433
                    million tonnes of lignite that year.

                <div class="txt_section txt_section_indent">
                    Lots of brown coal is mined throughout the country but one
                    region located primarily in
                    the middle of Germany is the Rhenish coalfields. These coal
                    fields are home to forests, towns,
                    and open-pit lignite mines among other things. Open-pit
                    lignite mining causes many
                    environmental changes, a specific one being the detrimental
                    effects on ground and drinking
                    water through Acid Mine Drainage (AMD). Through the mining
                    process water is contaminated
                    and released back into the surrounding environment which
                    then drains into groundwater stocks.
                    AMD is a geochemical flow which occurs when atmospheric
                    oxygen reacts with sulphuric
                    compounds unearthed during mining, producing acidic and
                    metal-rich runoff which can be
                    classified as grey water (Moncur, 2013). This process is an
                    externality of lignite mining. In the
                    Rhineland Coalfields the AMD is primarily caused by pyrite
                    oxidation products including Fe<sup>3+</sup> & Fe<sup>2+</sup>
                    ions along with
                    acidic SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> & H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>
                    ions (Wisotzky,
                    2001). The process is closely related to
                    a positive feedback cycle wherein green water from
                    precipitation or blue water from returning
                    groundwater dissolve pyritic Fe<sup>3+</sup>, Fe<sup>2+</sup>,
                    SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>, H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> ions
                    into the water lowering the pH
                    (Wisotzky, 2001). Then secondary minerals that are iron
                    sulphate containing also begin to enter
                    the water contributing to further contamination and
                    acidification exacerbating the problem. Once
                    this water has been contaminated it continues in its
                    geochemical flow back into the ground water
                    or streams where it can then mix with drinking water
                    supplies (Gerwin et al., 2023). The state of
                    the groundwater is often quite toxic, and in the mining
                    districts southern areas, the water is
                    extremely acidic, sometimes with a pH under 5 (Wisotzky,
                    2001). The process of AMD is a
                    common externality of lignite mining in the Rhineland
                    Coalfields and is detrimental to the
                    groundwater stocks of the region.

                    II. Root Cause of the Issue
                </div>

                <div class="txt_section txt_section_indent">
                    The root cause of Acid Mine Drainage in the Rhineland
                    Coalfields is the creation and
                    exploitation of open-pit mines. This however does not
                    explain the drivers behind the mining
                    operations and the use for the lignite once mined. There are
                    many potential societal activities
                    responsible for Germany's desire for low grade brown coal.
                    There are many economic factors
                    contributing to the need for lignite, but the predominant
                    driver is a political one. The majority of
                    the German government (Infratest dimap, 2022, p.12) and
                    populus (Amann, et al., 2022) have a
                    biassed risk perception towards clean and green energy. An
                    individual's risk perception is often
                    irrational and biassed, and many Germans don't see clean and
                    safe nuclear energy as worth the
                    risk, despite the risk being a small one. The belief that
                    nuclear power should not be used is
                    deeply ingrained in German culture, and has been held by
                    many Germans for a long time
                    (Appunn, 2021b). Prior to October of 2022 the government of
                    Germany has had a long standing
                    plan to shut down and decommission their only 3 remaining
                    nuclear reactors (Appunn, 2021b).
                    This plan has since changed due to a sudden need for any
                    energy source due to recent restrictions
                    on natural gas imports from Russia. Germany had originally
                    developed the plan to decommission
                    all nuclear power by 2022 when the Green Party and Social
                    Democrats won the 1998 elections
                    (Appunn, 2021b). Opposition to nuclear power was one of the
                    founding principles of The Green
                    Party of Germany, and remains a main part of their platform
                    today. Their founding was driven by
                    large protests of approximately 200,000 people in 1979, and
                    others prior (Appunn, 2021a).
                    Additional insight to the German public's risk aversion to
                    nuclear energy is demonstrated by a
                    poll from 1998 where only an astounding 3% of respondents
                    were in favour of continued
                    development of Germany's nuclear power industry (Amann, et
                    al., 2022). Many German citizens
                    were so opposed to nuclear energy in the late 1900s due to
                    accidents at 3 Mile Island and more
                    importantly, Chernobyl, due to its close proximity to
                    Germany. The government warned
                    residents against eating fresh produce grown in gardens and
                    suggested exchanging the sand in
                    the play pits at playgrounds for fear of radioactive
                    contamination (Appunn, 2016). This kept the
                    dangers of nuclear energy at the forefront of concerns for
                    the German people as it seemed so
                    immediate. The fear of nuclear energy is very deeply rooted
                    throughout German society and can
                    even be seen in the rhetoric of the German government. The
                    German Federal Office for the
                    Safety of Nuclear Waste Management (BASE) continuously
                    refers to all nuclear energy as a
                    “high-risk technology in Germany” (BASE, 2023) demonstrating
                    their strong belief that all nuclear power is inherently
                    dangerous. A further statement from BASE discusses the
                    knee-jerk
                    reaction to the Fukushima accident in Japan which was
                    immediately followed by a “nuclear
                    moratorium” (BASE, 2023). In March 2011 without much
                    consideration or deliberation the
                    so-called nuclear moratorium was put into place. This is
                    evidently an emotional decision of the
                    German government which was supported by the German people.
                    Due to low seismic activity in
                    Germany there is nearly no risk of an earthquake or tsunami
                    posed to any of the nuclear reactors
                    in Germany, making the comparison to Fukushima not ideal
                    from a risk management
                    perspective.
                </div>

                <div class="txt_section txt_section_indent">
                    The culture of risk in Germany also plays a large role in
                    public perception, as Europe and
                    Germany tend to operate on a precautionary principle. This
                    means a much more conservative
                    approach is taken towards potential hazards to try to
                    eliminate as much potential risk as possible.
                    Even though Germany has set the remaining 3 power plants to
                    shut down in April of 2023 it still
                    needs to find a home for the remaining radioactive waste
                    that will remain (BASE, 2023). The
                    selection process to find a location to sequester such
                    high-level nuclear waste (HLW) into deep
                    geological formations is underway, and a survey was
                    conducted in 2020 polling Germans on
                    their trust in various steps of the site selection process
                    (Seidl, et al., 2022). Across all 3 sample
                    clusters, trust in the process degraded (Table 1).
                    Especially illuminating is the 3rd cluster which is
                    deemed risk-focused and comprises 42% of the ~5000 people
                    sampled, who in the first stage
                    accept the procedure with a 4.7/7 confidence which quickly
                    degrades to a 1.9/5 in the last stage,
                    demonstrating a large subset of the population is
                    uncomfortable with the storage of nuclear
                    waste. Furthermore the researchers had expected a
                    benefit-oriented cluster, which was notably
                    absent from the German population, again showing how deeply
                    rooted the distrust and distaste
                    for nuclear power is. Due to the risk perception and
                    political views of the German people, they
                    are heavily opposed to nuclear power, and with its phase-out
                    underway they need to transition to
                    other energies. Due to Europe as a whole having increasingly
                    limited energy sources of only
                    ~3% globally, one of Germany's few abundant alternatives is
                    lignite, leading to increased mining
                    activity (Bezdek, 2014).
