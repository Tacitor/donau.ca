                    With a population of 84.5 million citizens the country of
                    Germany has a substantial
                    demand for energy (German Federal Statistical Office, 2022).
                    Much of the electricity production
                    within the nation is through fossil fuels, with 20.1% of
                    power being produced through lignite
                    production (German Federal Statistical Office, 2023).
                    lignite—also referred to as brown coal—is
                    a low grade coal. It is inefficient and emits more CO2 when
                    compared to other types of fossil
                    fuels (University of Calgary, n.d.). Germany has had a long
                    standing dependance on lignite, with
                    it being used in place of wood as a fuel type beginning as
                    early as the 1600's (D-EITI, 2023). In
                    1985 Germany hit a historical record of extracting 433
                    million tonnes of lignite that year.

                    Lots of brown coal is mined throughout the country but one
                    region located primarily in
                    the middle of Germany is the Rhenish coalfields. These coal
                    fields are home to forests, towns,
                    and open-pit lignite mines among other things. Open-pit
                    lignite mining causes many
                    environmental changes, a specific one being the detrimental
                    effects on ground and drinking
                    water through Acid Mine Drainage (AMD). Through the mining
                    process water is contaminated
                    and released back into the surrounding environment which
                    then drains into groundwater stocks.
                    AMD is a geochemical flow which occurs when atmospheric
                    oxygen reacts with sulphuric
                    compounds unearthed during mining, producing acidic and
                    metal-rich runoff which can be
                    classified as grey water (Moncur, 2013). This process is an
                    externality of lignite mining. In the
                    Rhineland Coalfields the AMD is primarily caused by pyrite
                    oxidation products including Fe<sup>3+</sup> & Fe<sup>2+</sup>
                    ions along with
                    acidic SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> & H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>
                    ions (Wisotzky,
                    2001). The process is closely related to
                    a positive feedback cycle wherein green water from
                    precipitation or blue water from returning
                    groundwater dissolve pyritic Fe<sup>3+</sup>, Fe<sup>2+</sup>,
                    SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>, H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> ions
                    into the water lowering the pH
                    (Wisotzky, 2001). Then secondary minerals that are iron
                    sulphate containing also begin to enter
                    the water contributing to further contamination and
                    acidification exacerbating the problem. Once
                    this water has been contaminated it continues in its
                    geochemical flow back into the ground water
                    or streams where it can then mix with drinking water
                    supplies (Gerwin et al., 2023). The state of
                    the groundwater is often quite toxic, and in the mining
                    districts southern areas, the water is
                    extremely acidic, sometimes with a pH under 5 (Wisotzky,
                    2001). The process of AMD is a
                    common externality of lignite mining in the Rhineland
                    Coalfields and is detrimental to the
                    groundwater stocks of the region.
